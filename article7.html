      <h2>In the previous #MinuteInMedtech</h2>
      <p>I discussed the Tasso+ and Tasso-M20 devices, which revolutionize blood draw procedures for patients, ensuring convenience and efficient test results. Today, I am excited to show the ComeBack Mobility's Weight Bearing device, specifically designed to expedite the recovery process following an injury.</p>

      <h2>ComeBack Mobility's Weight Bearing Device</h2>
      <p>ComeBack Mobility is achieving its purpose and holds FDA registration. The device works by attaching to a set of crutches at the point where the crutch meets the floor. By using the patient's weight and the weight applied to the crutch, the device accurately measures the amount of weight being placed on the injured limb. The doctor has access to an app interface, where they can establish a customized weight zone for the patient. This information is then transmitted to the patient's app, which connects to the device via Bluetooth. The device flashes red when the patient needs to take a softer step and flashes white when the patient needs to take a harder step. No flash occurs if the patient is in the correct weight zone. Through the app, the patient can visualize the target weight they need to bear on their injury. By using these interactive apps, the patient and doctor can collaborate on a rehabilitation plan, with the doctor gradually increasing the weight zone over time.</p>

      <h2>Potential for Accelerated Rehabilitation</h2>
      <p>What attracted me to this device is its potential to expedite injury recovery. As a competitive cyclist, I deeply value a faster recuperation process in achieving optimal fitness. Whether it's following a nourishing diet, incorporating proper stretching routines, or ensuring sufficient rest, recovery plays a pivotal role. There's a saying that training accounts for 30% of progress, while recovery makes up the remaining 70%. Efficient and targeted recovery from injuries enables athletes to resume training more swiftly, leading to enhanced overall performance in the long run. ComeBack Mobility's Weight Bearing device exemplifies the potential for accelerated rehabilitation, offering a promising solution for a quicker and more effective recovery journey.</p>

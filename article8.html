      <h2>In the previous #MinuteInMedtech</h2>
      <p>I went into the field of rehabilitation with the ComeBack Mobility's Weight Bearing device. Today, I'll discuss another rehabilitation device, which, while similar in its objective to rehabilitate patients, differs in the type of injury it addresses. This device, developed by @ImagoRehab, focuses on improving arm control in individuals affected by stroke or spinal cord injury.</p>

      <h2>IMAGO Rehab's Arm Control Device</h2>
      <p>The IMAGO Rehab device is designed as a sleeve that mounts onto the arm, providing coverage for the arm, hand, and fingers. Strokes typically affect one side of the body due to the division of the brain by the Corpus Callosum. If a blood clot occurs in the left side of the brain, for example, the right side of the body is impacted. In the case of this device, if a stroke survivor experiences impaired function in their right arm, IMAGO Rehab's device offers at-home rehabilitation through grip assistance and stretch therapy. The patient can continue using the device until they regain control of their arm. Progress data can be collected and transmitted to the doctor, eliminating the necessity for in-person care. Rehabilitation can be completed in the comfort of the patient's own home. It's worth noting that this device isn't limited to assisting stroke survivors alone; it can also benefit patients with spinal cord injuries.</p>

      <h2>Distinct Approaches to Rehabilitation</h2>
      <p>What captivated me about this device is its similarities and differences in comparison to the previous Weight Bearing device. Both devices leverage the concept of Remote Patient Monitoring and aim to restore patients to good physical condition following an injury. However, the approaches they employ to achieve these goals are distinct, fascinating, and unique. The device from ComeBack Mobility uses the idea of increasing the strength of a muscle, while IMAGO Rehab's device focuses on Neuromuscular rehabilitation, enhancing the neural signals being sent to the arm from the brain.</p>

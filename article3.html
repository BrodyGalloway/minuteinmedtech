  <h1>Minute in Medtech: Wearable Blood Flow Sensor by STAT Health</h1>
  <p>In the last #MinuteInMedtech, we discussed the Biotres, a chest worn device that can detect cardiovascular abnormalities. Today, we will take a look at STAT Healthâ€™s Wearable Blood Flow Sensor that mounts in the ear to monitor blood flow and blood pressure levels. Let's dive into it!</p>

  <p>There is so much that we can learn about our bodies through blood. It's no wonder doctors regularly perform blood draws for diagnoses or routine tests. Although this device does not analyze blood at a molecular level, it examines blood flow and pressure from the outside of your body.</p>

  <p>The first thing that came to mind when researching this device was a blood pressure cuff. While this device cannot measure systolic and diastolic pressures, it still provides a wealth of information. It can reveal the reasons behind fatigue and headaches, and it can also alert doctors and patients to dangerously low blood pressure before the loss of consciousness. This data could assist with chronic disease management, stress, and post surgical monitoring. Individuals managing chronic diseases like diabetes or hypertension can utilize this device to track treatment effectiveness and manage symptoms based on the collected data. Moreover, since stress levels are closely linked to blood pressure, individuals can utilize this device to acknowledge stress and take proactive steps to cope with it. With surgical monitoring, This device can help detect any potential complications earlier and ensure a smoother recovery process. The potential applications of this device are countless, and these are just a few examples.</p>

  <p>What stood out the most about this device is its small size. With the device in a patient's ear, they can still use earbuds, headphones, and other ear-related devices. The device connects to your phone and provides continuous data on blood flow and heart rate. All in all, it is cool to see how such a small device can monitor a significant amount of useful data.</p>

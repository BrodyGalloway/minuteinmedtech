# Minute in Medtech

*A perspective from an aspiring Biomedical Engineer, Competitive Cyclist, CHD Warrior, and typical(?) Teen...*

In my last #MinuteInMedTech, we discussed the Frontier X2, an innovative heart rate monitor with 24/7 ECG monitoring, primarily designed for athletic training and exercise science. Today, I came across another intriguing product called Biotres, which shares similarities with the Frontier X2 in terms of technology but serves a different purpose. Biotres, an FDA cleared device, aims to replace Holter monitors in order to improve cardiovascular patients' health through Remote Patient Monitoring.

Having personally used Holter monitors in the past, this struck my eye. Unlike a Holter monitor, which you would have to ship back to the cardiologist after wearing it for a few days, the data can now be simply uploaded for analysis through a smartphone. The doctor then examines the uploaded data and provides a diagnosis. Biotricity claims that this process can significantly reduce diagnosis time from 2 weeks to 3-5 days.

The concept of remote data upload and analysis has been successfully employed in the athletic field for years. When I record my cycling rides, I upload the data from my basic heart rate monitor from [@Garmin](https://www.garmin.com) for my coach to analyze, leading to informed decisions on future training plans. The fact that this concept is being made available when diagnosing cardiovascular conditions is game-changing.

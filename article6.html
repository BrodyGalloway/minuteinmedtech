      <h2>Previously in #MinuteInMedtech</h2>
      <p>I introduced the WHOOP 4.0 strap, a wearable tool for athletes. Today, we venture back into the realm of blood data, exploring a different device: a blood draw device designed for patient use. It is made by Tasso and is called the Tasso+.</p>

      <h2>Tasso+</h2>
      <p>Enter the Tasso+. This innovative device further advances the concept of faster and more accessible healthcare. Patients can utilize the Tasso+ by simply pressing a button while positioning the device next to their arm. Once the blood is drawn, the patient can conveniently ship the sample to the doctor, where tests can be conducted and diagnoses made. When I first encountered the Tasso+, it brought to mind the functionality of a Holter monitor or even the Biotres device. The notion of enabling individuals to access medical care from the comfort of their own homes reduces the need for frequent visits to doctors' offices and facilitates faster test results. It seems that medical device companies are increasingly focused on these goals: minimizing the time wasted on unnecessary doctor's visits and enhancing healthcare accessibility for patients.</p>

      <h2>Tasso-M20</h2>
      <p>Moreover, the Tasso+ has a companion device called the Tasso-M20. Its purpose is to simplify clinical trials by allowing volunteers to participate from the comfort of their homes. This device employs similar principles, whereby blood samples are shipped to the lab to assess the effectiveness of the medication being tested. This breakthrough has significant implications as it has the potential to expedite FDA clearance for numerous biotech companies, revolutionizing the field of clinical trials.</p>

# Minute in Medtech

*A perspective from an aspiring Biomedical Engineer, Competitive Cyclist, CHD Warrior, and typical(?) Teen…*

Today I am sharing the Fourth Frontier’s wearable chest strap called the FrontierX2. The Frontier X2 is an innovative 24/7 wearable heart rate monitor. According to their website, this device is the “World’s first chest-worn Smart Heart Monitor that provides in-depth real-time feedback on your heart health”. As an athlete, getting real-time information about your cardiovascular performance can be valuable to perform at your best.

One aspect that particularly excites me is the Frontier X2's ability to constantly track ECG (Electrocardiogram), providing a comprehensive view of a heart's electrical activity. This feature empowers coaches or other users to get a more detailed level of output and make informed decisions accordingly.

As an athlete with a heart condition called Truncus Arteriosus, I have a unique heart based on having prior surgeries. With the right tools, I can push the boundaries of my performance while ensuring my heart health is in good condition. The Frontier X2 presents an exciting opportunity for me to monitor and optimize my training with the added benefit of enhanced coaching insights of ECG, HRV, and real-time feedback.

  <p><em>A perspective from an aspiring Biomedical Engineer, Competitive Cyclist, CHD Warrior, and typical(?) Teen...</em></p>
  
  <p>In my last <strong>#MinuteInMedTech</strong>, we discussed the Frontier X2, an innovative heart rate monitor with 24/7 ECG monitoring, primarily designed for athletic training and exercise science. Today, I came across another intriguing product called Biotres, which shares similarities with the Frontier X2 in terms of technology but serves a different purpose. Biotres, an FDA cleared device, aims to replace Holter monitors in order to improve cardiovascular patients' health through Remote Patient Monitoring.</p>
  
  <p>Having personally used Holter monitors in the past, this struck my eye. Unlike a Holter monitor, which you would have to ship back to the cardiologist after wearing it for a few days, the data can now be simply uploaded for analysis through a smartphone. The doctor then examines the uploaded data and provides a diagnosis. Biotricity claims that this process can significantly reduce diagnosis time from 2 weeks to 3-5 days.</p>
  
  <p>The concept of remote data upload and analysis has been successfully employed in the athletic field for years. When I record my cycling rides, I upload the data from my basic heart rate monitor from <a href="https://www.garmin.com" target="_blank">@Garmin</a> for my coach to analyze, leading to informed decisions on future training plans. The fact that this concept is being made available when diagnosing cardiovascular conditions is game-changing.</p>
